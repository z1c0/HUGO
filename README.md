**HUGO** is an open source modular dashboard platform. It's intened for personal or family
use to display information like shared calendars, weather, pictures or bus times.

It is built on a modular plugin system and runs on [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com).

## Modules

These modules are currently part of the default installation.

- **hello**
- **calendar**
- **news**
- **pictures**
- **weather**
- **bus monitor**
- **abc**

Some of these modules and their functionality (e.g *bus monitor*) are very specific 
to my personal needs and use cases. Nonetheless, the open and modular architecture should
allow for easy adaptions.
